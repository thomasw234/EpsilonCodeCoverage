EpsilonCodeCoverage
===================

The code coverage framework for Epsilon.

The files included here would need to be included in the Epsilon source code in the packages indicated by the folder names.

Each of the analysis classes has a main method, and so these can be run as Java applications to perform the analysis. There is a hard coded string in the Epsilon class EolParserWorkbench which should be modified to change the target of the analysis.
